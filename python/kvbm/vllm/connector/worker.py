"""
vLLM KV-connector worker wired to the Rust ConnectorWorker.

The Python class adapts vLLM's KVConnectorBase_V1 worker-side hooks to
the Rust `ConnectorWorker` in `lib/kvbm-connector/src/connector/worker/`,
which performs the four runtime actions documented at the top of that
crate: intra-pass onboard (G2→G1 per-layer H2D with CudaEvent sync on
the torch compute stream), inter-pass onboard driven by the leader via
the VeloWorkerService/DirectWorker, forward-pass completion notification
back to the leader, and direct layer-wise offload.

On worker bring-up the Python side builds a `KvbmRuntime` (Velo messenger
+ tokio) and a `ConnectorWorker` over it, exports its Velo peer info as
`VeloPeerMetadata` for the leader's `set_xfer_handshake_metadata`, and
defers NIXL registration until `register_kv_caches` — the actual NIXL
bind happens later, when the leader's `initialize_workers()` RPC drives
`configure_layouts` with final G2/G3 block counts.
