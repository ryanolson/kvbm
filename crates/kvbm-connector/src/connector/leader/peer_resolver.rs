//! Resolve a remote `InstanceId` to its `PeerInfo` and register it on the
//! local velo messenger.
//!
//! The disagg prefill coordinator needs to talk velo with the
//! decode peer that pushed it a request, but the only identifier carried in
//! `RemotePrefillRequest` is decode's `initiator_instance_id`. The hub holds
//! the `PeerInfo` (registered at decode-startup time); this trait closes the
//! loop by looking it up and feeding it to `velo.register_peer`. The
//! coordinator caches successful resolves locally so repeat requests for the
//! same peer don't re-pay the round-trip.
//!
//! The trait itself lives in `kvbm_engine::p2p::session` because
//! `VeloSessionFactory` also needs the hook (both the puller-side `attach`
//! and the holder-side `Frame::Attach` receive path call `attach_anchor`,
//! which fails if the peer isn't already in velo's streaming registry).
//! We re-export it here so connector callers import it from
//! `crate::connector::leader::peer_resolver`.
