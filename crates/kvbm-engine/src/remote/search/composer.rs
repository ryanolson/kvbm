//! Onboarding composer: layered tier composition for AsyncSession finds.
//!
//! Spawned by [`InstanceLeader::find_matches_with_options`] whenever the
//! synchronous local match leaves work to do (local G3 to stage, a remote
//! tail to pull, or both). The composer overlaps the discovery RPC with the
//! G3→G2 staging transfer, then issues the remote pull against the **actual**
//! post-staging local prefix — a final single
//! [`BlockManager::match_blocks`](kvbm_logical::manager::BlockManager::match_blocks)
//! over the full sequence collapses whatever each tier registered into the
//! contiguous prefix the caller sees.
//!
//! ## Tier composition
//!
//! - **G3→G2 staging**: when [`InstanceLeader::parallel_worker`] is present and
//!   the synchronous G3 match returned blocks, stage them into G2 via
//!   [`stage_g3_to_g2`]. Staging signals `staging_settled` on completion
//!   (success or failure) via a [`Drop`] guard so the remote-pull continuation
//!   can compute its target from the truthful post-staging G2 prefix.
//! - **Hub-indexer remote pull**: when remote search is enabled the composer
//!   builds a [`plan::DiscoveryPlan`] over the *expected* post-staging
//!   remaining range, fires the (decimated, ≤64-hash) query concurrently
//!   with staging, then — after staging has settled and we have the truthful
//!   post-staging local prefix — resolves the indexer's `deepest` sample
//!   into a pin range and pulls from the first reachable candidate. The
//!   decimation + pin-target arithmetic lives in
//!   [`DiscoveryPlan`](plan::DiscoveryPlan) so the composer is just glue.
//!
//! Decoupling the pull target from the *expected* post-staging position
//! (`local_g2_count + local_g3_count`) closes two races the optimistic
//! projection would hit: (1) the bridge-hole case — G2 already holds blocks
//! past the staging range so the post-staging prefix is longer than the sum;
//! (2) the staging-failure case — the prefix is just `local_g2_count` because
//! G3 contributed nothing. Either way, the re-match below feeds the pull the
//! truthful starting position.
//!
//! ## Failure model
//!
//! Either child failing (staging error, discovery miss, pull RPC failure,
//! cancellation, timeout) is logged and degrades to "no contribution from
//! that tier". The composer always reaches a terminal
//! [`OnboardingStatus::Complete`] so the connector's shard never wedges
//! non-terminal — the contiguous prefix that did land determines
//! `matched_blocks`.
