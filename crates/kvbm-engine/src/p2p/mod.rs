//! Engine-owned disaggregation session protocol and helpers.
//!
//! Hub-visible request metadata lives in `kvbm-protocols (disagg)`. The
//! [`session`] submodule owns the symmetric `Session` API + its production
//! ([`session::VeloSession`]) and test ([`session::MockSession`]) impls.
//!
//! This module also re-exports the small data types used by the engine's
//! RDMA primitive (`InstanceLeader::pull_remote_block_sets`) and by
//! `VeloSession::pull`: [`RemoteBlockRef`] and [`RemoteBlockSet`], plus
//! [`SessionEndpoint`] from `kvbm-protocols (disagg)`.
//!
//! Also home to the p2p mechanism layer extracted from leader/: pull planning, metadata transport, parallelism templates, the leader velo service, and the transfer control module.
