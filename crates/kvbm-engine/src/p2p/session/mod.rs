//! Bidirectional CD session — symmetric trait both decode and
//! prefill program against.
//!
//! Each side advertises *intent* (committed hashes) and
//! *capability* (available blocks, in G2, pinned, ready to
//! pull). Strict invariant: `available ⊆ committed`. Both
//! sets are monotonic-add only within a session lifetime.
//!
//! The wire is one bidirectional `Frame` stream. The session
//! implementation demuxes incoming frames into separate
//! single-consumer mpsc channels — one per
//! trait-surface stream. Callers see independent
//! [`Session::commits`] / [`Session::availability`] /
//! [`Session::lifecycle`] streams; the implementation handles
//! the demux.
