//! Host GPU / NUMA / CPU resource discovery.
//!
//! [`Resources::discover`] produces an immutable snapshot of every NVIDIA GPU on
//! the host, the NUMA topology, and a deterministic per-GPU slice of the
//! relevant CPU set so that multiple GPUs sharing a NUMA node do not contend
//! for the same cores. Allocation is intentionally out of scope — this module
//! describes the system, it does not change it.
//!
//! ## Container safety
//!
//! GPU enumeration is driven by sysfs (`/sys/bus/pci/devices`), which is not
//! network-namespaced and reflects host topology even when NVML's view is
//! restricted by the container runtime. NVML is only consulted to fill in
//! details sysfs cannot provide.
//!
//! ## Slicing policy
//!
//! By default ([`SlicingMode::AssumeAllBusy`]), each NUMA node's CPU list is
//! divided evenly across **every** host GPU on that node, even GPUs the
//! current process cannot address. This prevents a container holding 2 of 8
//! host GPUs from claiming all of a node's CPUs and fighting siblings on the
//! same box. [`SlicingMode::VisibleOnly`] is available for callers that own
//! every GPU on the host.
//!
//! ## Fallbacks
//!
//! Funky topologies (no NUMA, GPUs without affinity info, memory-only NUMA
//! nodes, missing sysfs) never produce errors. Each GPU's [`SliceSource`]
//! tags how its slice was derived; see the variants for details.
