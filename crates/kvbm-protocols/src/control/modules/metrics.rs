//! `metrics` module protocol: on-demand runtime snapshot.
//!
//! A small, dev-/test-oriented snapshot of the numbers an engineer most often
//! wants to eyeball without standing up Prometheus: per-pool block populations
//! (focus on G2; G3 included when present) and the count of in-flight disagg
//! sessions. Production observability is unchanged — each leader keeps
//! exporting the full Prometheus surface via
//! `kvbm_observability::start_metrics_server`. This handler is read-only and
//! sources its numbers from the same `prometheus::Registry`, so values match
//! exactly what Prometheus would scrape at the same instant.
