"""
Aggregated determinism matrix: G1 registration path × G2 block layout.

Companion to `test_determinism_agg.py` (which keeps the MLA coverage).
This file pins the matrix that the new connector dimensions opened up:

    G1 = LayerSeparate (LW)        G1 = FullyContiguous (FC)
    G2 = Operational      ✓            ✓
    G2 = Universal        ✓            ✓

Four specs, all on Qwen3-0.6B (small fast iter target; MLA is excluded
because FC does not support 3-dim fused K/V). Single onboard mode (inter)
on first pass — extend to {intra, inter} cross when the matrix proves stable.

The reuse-base determinism check (`base_test_determinism_with_cache_reset`)
catches output divergence across the cache reset. On top of that, this
module asserts:

  1. KVBM actually exercised offload+onboard during the run. If it did
     not, the determinism check would silently pass with KVBM disabled.
     Asserted via metrics-endpoint deltas across phase 1 / cache reset /
     phase 2.

  2. The G1 path was the one the spec requested. Read back from the
     server stdout log (the connector logs
     `[KVBM] prefer_cross_layer_blocks={True,False}` and
     `[KVBM] {Cross-layer KV cache,KV caches} registered`).

  3. G2 utilization is surfaced in the test output so we can iterate on
     `cpu_blocks` sizing. The cell with the largest G2 footprint pins
     the cluster-wide minimum.

# Default 40: deliberately conservative calibration value. We do NOT yet
# have real G2 utilization numbers from this matrix (a previous draft
# extrapolated off synthetic adversarial-test data and landed on 200,
# which was unsubstantiated). 40 gives each unique Shakespeare prompt
# one recorded issuance, each control prompt ~4 issuances per phase
# (control_interval=10), and each random prompt ~5-6 issuances
# (random_interval=7) — enough to surface routing regressions without
# blowing G2 capacity. After the first real run reports per-cell
# utilization, ratchet up to push the heaviest cell toward 75%.
#
# Set `KVBM_MATRIX_MAX_ITERATIONS=10` for fast iteration cycles
# (structural assertions still fire; determinism signal is weaker).
#
# This is resolved ONCE at import time and applied to each per-test
# `kvbm_tester` instance inside the test body. We deliberately do NOT
# mutate `os.environ["KVBM_MAX_ITERATIONS"]` here — pytest imports all
# test modules during collection, and a module-level env mutation
# would leak into sibling test modules (e.g.
# `test_determinism_agg.py` reads `KVBM_MAX_ITERATIONS` at its OWN
# module load to compute timeouts, and `DeterminismTester.__init__`
# reads it again per-instance). Setting the value on the tester
# instance keeps the iteration override scoped to this test.
